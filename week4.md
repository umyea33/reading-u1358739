The four fields that defines a tool for an AI are a name that identifies the tool, a description that describes what the tool is, when to use it, and when to not use it, an input schema that defines what inputs need to be present in order to use this tool, and a function that simply executes the tool/command and returns the results.  The tool description is sent to the model before the user even types anything.  This is basically getting the AI familiar with its environment before setting it to work.  The function is run everytime the AI wants to use the tool.  It tells the user (the code) the tool it wants to use then the user runs the function related to that tool.  The input schema is used everytime the AI wants to use the tool.  Before it actually calls the tool (tells the user it wants to use a tool) then it refers back to the input schema to see what inputs it needs to provide in order to use that tool.  These four parts work together to give us what we see in amp.  Each part is necessary for this to work.  The name is needed to identify each tool.  Without a description of the tool then the AI would never know what it is capable of doing.  Without the input schema the AI wouldn't be able to format the tool usage in the right way, and finally without the actual function, the code would not be able to execute the actual tool/command.

One thing I noticed this blog post said that I don't do in my test suite is grouping tests into different features.  Right now my entire test suite is just one file and I can split this up into a file for each feature.  Another thing I noticed in my test suite is that it takes quite a long time to run my tests.  I feel like there are some things that I test over and over again and it feels a little overkill.  To fix this I can go through and see if I can remove any duplicate tests.  I also noticed that when I am testing my code I end up running my tests several times when fixing the same bug.  I can prioritize my testing by only running a certain group of tests while fixing a bug, then when I think the bug is fixed I can run all the other tests.  This will make so it doesn't take amp so long to fix every single little bug.
